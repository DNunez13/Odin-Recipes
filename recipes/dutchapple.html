    <h2>Ingrediants</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>2 (14.1 ounce) packages refrigerated pie dough (such as Pillsbury®)</li>
        <li>1 (21 ounce) can apple pie filling</li>
        <li>⅓ cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>⅓ cup packed brown sugar</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons cold unsalted butter, cubed</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
        <br>
        <li>Roll out each circle of pie dough to 1/8-inch thickness. Cut circles into the dough using a 2 1/2-inch round cookie cutter (as many circles as you can).</li>
        <br>
        <li>Fold each circle in half and pinch the ends of each side together to make a boat shape with an open top. Spoon about 1/2 tablespoon of pie filling into the dough "pocket" and place it face-up at the edge of a 9- or 10-inch springform pan. Repeat with the remaining dough circles, wrapping around the edge of the pan and overlapping with the last piece slightly until the pan is full.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Mix flour, brown sugar, butter, and cinnamon together with a fork or pastry cutter in a bowl until mixture forms into crumbs. Spoon crumble topping on top of the pieces of pie.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the edges of the dough and the crumble topping turn golden, 17 to 20 minutes. Cool for a few minutes before serving.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Place the pan on a serving platter and remove the side of the springform pan, leaving the pie and the base of the pan on the serving dish. Pull apart the amount of pieces you'd like to eat.</li>
    </ol>
